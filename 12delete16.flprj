The output has been designed to have minimal navigation, with focus on the slideshows themselves. You might use this template if you are looking for an alternative to a PowerPoint presentation. This template starts you out with an HTML5 target. You can add other kinds of targets if you like. You can also insert slideshows into the other online templates."
